	Renamed package to Fvwm95 Forever and moved to GitHub.
	PACKAGE_VERSION = "Forever"

	Fixed FTBs for GCC 15.

	Merged BUGS and NEVERDO into README.md.

2020-12-10 David Flater

	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf8

	* Fixed multiple definitions of global variables in modules
	FvwmScroll and FvwmTaskBar.  GCC 10 changed the default behavior
	from -fcommon to -fno-common, which caused these multiple
	definitions to be rejected.

2020-03-18 David Flater

	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf7

	* Fixed buffer overflows in fvwm/read.c SendDataToModule which
	were triggered by a long IconPath or PixmapPath.

	* Added mini-firefox.xpm.

	* Updated system.fvwm95rc.in:
	- Added Firefox;
	- Added dosbox-x to the workaround for SDL2 fullscreen lossage;
	- Disabled Alt-arrow hotkeys (shortcuts to scroll by 1/10 of a
	page) to stop conflict with Doom (Alt = strafe).

	* Updated INSTALL.

2018-01-22 David Flater

	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf6

	* Updated system.fvwm95rc.in:
	- Fixed usage of killall;
	- Added the fullscreen workaround to chocolate-doom etc.;
	- Comments.

	* Updated INSTALL.

2017-04-20 David Flater

	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf5

	* Replaced faulty recursive build system with monolithic Automake:
        - Added script utils/makemakefileam.sh to generate Makefile.am;
	- Replaced configure.ac;
	- Purged all Imakefile and Makefile.in;
	- Adjusted install and search paths to agree with modern Linux.

	* Fixed innumerable instances of overflow, underflow, corruption,
	undefined behavior, division by zero, and broken parsing which
	were responsible for crashes and misbehavior in fvwm95 and every
	module.

	* Cleaned up compiler warnings through -Wall -Wno-parentheses on
	GCC 6.3.0.  Left the following:
	  ButtonArray.c:
	    warning: statement with no effect (BOGUS)
          etc:
  	    warning: the use of `mktemp' is dangerous, better use `mkstemp'
	    warning: implicit declaration of function 'ConsoleMessage' (BOGUS)

	* Harmonized swallow triggers in FvwmButtons, FvwmWharf,
	FvwmTaskBar, and FvwmScript (SwallowExec) to match on resource
	name (Resource), resource class (Class), or window name (Name),
	but not icon name (Icon Name).

	* Fixed fvwm95 bugs:
	- windows suddenly becoming enormous when resizing occurs near the
	  edge of the virtual desktop;
	- full-screen glitch when resizing a window that was declared with
  	  NoHandles and BorderWidth 0;
	- UseStyle option not accepting quoted identifiers;
	- false matching by UseStyle option;
	- no default WindowManagerName for Restart command (now fvwm95).

	* Fixed FvwmAudio bugs:
	- playing wrong or no sounds;
	- hanging, waiting on subprocesses to exit;
	- breaking audio_filename at whitespace.

	* Fixed FvwmConsole not using libreadline by default.

	* Fixed FvwmScript and sample scripts bugs:
	- missing default for FvwmScriptPath;
	- references to non-existent things in Buttons script;
	- infinite loop in PointerSetup script (but it is hopelessly fragile
	  and may hang on another system).

	* Fixed FvwmTaskBar bugs:
	- swallowing completely broken;
	- animation broken or too fast;
	- main event loop complexity;
	- no warning on missing *FvwmTaskBarGoodyLoadableSymbol;
	- bad geometry, location, and spacing of goodies;
	- bad calibration of x coordinates on mouse clicks on goodies;
	- area cleared different than area drawn;
	- missing default for FvwmTaskBarModuleIconPathBatStat;
	- only allowing one directory in FvwmTaskBarModuleIconPathBatStat.

	* Fixed FvwmWharf bugs:
	- black box over first button when swallowing failed;
	- wrong background colors on 32-bit arch;
	- animation too fast.

	* Corrected inaccuracies in man pages and HTML docs:
	- Documented the swallow commands for FvwmTaskBar;
	- Corrected description of the swallow commands for FvwmWharf;
	- Fixed ghost reference to FvwmInitBanner;
	- Corrected description of the name-matching behavior of the Style
  	  command to agree with what is actually done in fvwm/add_window.c
	  LookInList.

	* Made a few minor additions and enhancements:
	- Replaced the sample/default system.fvwm95rc;
	- Made FvwmTaskBar goodies work by single-click;
	- Improved error reporting by GoodyLoadable.c;
	- Added mini-xemacs.xpm, mini-chrome.xpm, mini-chromium.xpm,
	  mini-wilber16.xpm, and green.xpm;
	- Added LogoTest script.

	* Cleaned up random things:
	- Merged all needed preprocessor defines into FVWMconfig.h and made
	  all sources include it;
	- Removed version.h headers and declarations that conflicted with
	  FVWMconfig.h;
	- Merged index.html and GPL.html in with the other HTML files;
	- Merged xpmroot into utils;
	- Merged and purged duplicative icon collections:
	  - FvwmScript/Scripts/some_nice_icons:
	      moved shutdown.xpm to pixmaps/shutdown2.xpm
	      moved window.xpm to pixmaps/window2.xpm
	  - FvwmTaskBar/icons:
	      moved mini-mail.xpm to mini-icons/mini-mail2.xpm
	      moved minimail.xbm to mini-icons/minimail.xbm
	- Fixed saferealloc and made UpdateString use it (3 copies);
	- Moved random READMEs, example files, etc. from module
	  subdirectories into docs/modules;
	- Moved other random READMEs, example files, etc. into docs/random;
	- Moved the untested/unmaintained ASSound and OffiX subdirs of
	  FvwmWharf to docs/modules/FvwmWharf;
	- Deleted all other unused source files and scripts;
	- Normalized file permissions;
	- Stripped trailing whitespace.

	Not done:  see BUGS, NEVERDO.

2014-01-26 David Flater

	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf4

	* Fixed BatStatModule showing "charging" icon instead of "online"
	when fully charged.

	* Changed the "alert" and "empty" levels from 10% and 5% to 7% and
	2% respectively.

2014-01-25 David Flater

 	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf3

	* Fixed crash of FvwmTaskBar when a goody (BatStatModule) returned
	NULL from its init function to signify failure to init.

	* Updated BatStatModule to work with /sys/class/power_supply.
	Only BAT0 is monitored.  The legacy APM proc interface is still
	theoretically supported but has been modified without regression
	testing.

	* Enhanced mouseover status messages for BatStatModule.

	* Removed extra spaces from BatStatModule error and debug messages.

Sun Sep 1 2013 David Flater

	fvwm95-2.0.43f-dwf1

	* Patched to make it build with GCC 4.4.4 on x86_64 Linux.

Sat Aug 10 2002

	* Fixed return type of 'main' in modules (must be 'int').

Fri Aug 9 2002

	* Applied the stacking order patch from ??

	  This patch changes three things:

          1. FVWM now keeps track of window stacking order:

	  First, it makes FVWM keep track of the stacking order of the
	  windows, by using a second set of chain pointers (the original
	  chain keeps track of the order in which windows have been focused,
	  which is often not the same as the stacking order). So now FVWM
	  can easily answer the question "who's on third?" at any time (and,
	  since the new chain is closed into a ring anchored at both ends on
	  Scr.FvwmRoot, it can tell you who's third from the bottom as
	  quickly as who's third from the top).

	  2. Reversal of window stacking order when FVWM restarts:

	  Second, by using this new-found knowledge, FVWM will reparent
	  windows back to the root window (on a Restart or a Recapture
	  operation) in the reverse of the current stacking order. This
	  eliminates the old quirk of having the stacking order appear more
	  or less reversed after restarting FVWM.

	  3. Smoother, faster page/desk transition

	  Third, it restructures the the Desktop and Viewport (page)
	  switching routines to perform a simultaneous bidirectional loop
	  through the window list (via the new stacking order chain).
	  Windows that are moving off the visible screen are unmapped/moved
	  from the bottom of the stacking order upwards. Windows that are
	  moving onto the visible screen are mapped/moved from the top down.

	  The intent is to minimize the amount of expose/redraw overhead
	  during these operations when there are a number of overlapping
	  windows involved.  It also serves to equalize the visual
	  disturbance between the moving-out and the moving-in operations.
	  Previously, moving out of a page/desktop with many overlapping
	  windows could be disturbing and slow because, as the windows moved
	  from the top down, the ones underneath got redrawn as they were
	  exposed. Moving into such a page/desktop, on the other hand, would
	  appear quick and smooth because, as the upper windows appeared
	  first, the underlying portions of the subsequently mapped/moved
	  windows didn't need to get drawn.

	  Now, if you never have any overlapping windows on your desktop,
	  you won't see any improvement from this. If you only occasionally
	  have a couple of overlapping windows, you might not notice any
	  difference. But if you have several windows that overlap
	  significantly, the transition to or from the page where they are
	  should be very noticeably quicker and smoother.
